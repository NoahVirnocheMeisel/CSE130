# Assignment 4 directory

This directory contains source code and other files for the Multi-Threaded HTTP server assingment for CSE 130. The project involved using a solution to the reader/writer locking problem created in assingment 3 to implement a multi-threaded HTTP server capable of handling GET and PUT requests efficently.

Code in handle_connection.c/h, httpserver.c, and request_parser.c/h was written by myself for this assingment. Other files were provided for the class. Things like the rwlock and queue were implemented in previous assingments and we were given known to work versions to simplify the potential pitfalls in this assingment.
