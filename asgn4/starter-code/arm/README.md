# This directory contains the ARM asgn4_helper_funcs.a library file.

1. We will use the other library (x86) for grading.

2. You should test your code using the other library (x86).

3. You may use this ARM library FOR DEVELOPMENT.

4. We have seen differences in how programs run using the x86 library and
   using the ARM library.

5. You should test your code using the other library (x86).

Yes, #2 and #5 are the same.  That statement is important enough to repeat!
Your code will be graded using the x86 library.  So it's okay to develop
source code under ARM, but you REALLY need to test under x86 before turning
in your final version.
